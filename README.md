<!---![Sahya](sahya.jpg)--->
*Here you can find various modules (coded in python) used to build SAHYA*

## Face Recognition ü§ñ
Using the [*face_recognition*](https://pypi.org/project/face_recognition/) library Sahya is able to finely recognize the people present in her dataset and greet them using [*text_to_speech*](https://pythonprogramminglanguage.com/text-to-speech/) module. 
#### Pre-Requisites
- [*face_recognition*](https://pypi.org/project/face_recognition/)

make sure you have the specified libraries installed to run the text_to_speech module which is mentioned in the `speech` folder.

## Object Detection ü§ñ
Using the [YOLO](https://towardsdatascience.com/yolo-you-only-look-once-real-time-object-detection-explained-492dc9230006) algorithm,(You only look once) which is an object detection system targeted for real-time processing, Sahya is able to detect objects using the pre-trained data.
#### Pre-Requisites
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*kindly look into the* `setup.md` *file for running the code smoothly*

## Speech ü§ñ
